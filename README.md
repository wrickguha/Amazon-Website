# Amazon-Website
This is a simple Amazon clone project that aims to replicate the basic structure and styling of the Amazon website using HTML and CSS. It's a non-functional clone, which means it doesn't have e-commerce functionality, but it provides a starting point for building a functional e-commerce site.

The project includes a responsive design to ensure it works well on various screen sizes, from desktop to mobile. The clone project consists of the main landing page, a product listing page, a product detail page, and a shopping cart page.
